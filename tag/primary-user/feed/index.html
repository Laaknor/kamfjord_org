										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My old employer (local goverment) got a message from Microsoft about an audit. Since they have an education and an enterprise agreement, they need to get a list of all computers that can go under education-agreement (since that is the cheapest ) and everything else that goes under the enterprise agreement. When I was working there, I would have used which IP subnet the machine is from to sort the machines, but since they now have a lot of machines only reporting their IP from a shared wireless subnet, that&#8217;s harder. Instead, I figured out that we could use top console user to get a list, in addition to the AD Site.</p>
<p>Created a user collection with all users that are considered educational (department groups or other access groups). The collection got the name CEN00XXX.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran the following SQL-query to get a list of systems that had been online for the last 2 months.</p>
<p>SELECT sys.Netbios_Name0,<br />
um.TopConsoleUser0,<br />
[Last_Logon_Timestamp0],<br />
(SELECT CASE WHEN TopConsoleUser0 IS NULL THEN &#8216;False&#8217; ELSE &#8216;True&#8217; END AS IsSkole FROM <strong>_RES_COLL_CEN00XXX</strong> WHERE SMSID = um.TopConsoleUser0 ) AS userIsEdu,<br />
CASE WHEN [AD_Site_Name0] LIKE &#8216;<strong>EducationSite</strong>&#8216; THEN &#8216;True&#8217; ELSE &#8216;False&#8217; END AS SiteIsEdu,</p>
<p>FROM v_R_System sys<br />
LEFT OUTER JOIN v_GS_SYSTEM_CONSOLE_USAGE_MAXGROUP um<br />
ON um.ResourceID = sys.ResourceID<br />
WHERE Last_Logon_Timestamp0 IS NOT NULL<br />
AND Last_Logon_Timestamp0 &gt; DATEADD(<strong>month, -2</strong>, GETDATE())<br />
ORDER BY Last_Logon_Timestamp0</p>
